## Overview 

The Script uploads an .exe file to the VirusTotal platform, carrying out research on this file and collecting all its behaviors observed by the VirusTotal sandbox, and MITER ATT&CK tactics and techniques.

## Requirements

You will need to install a python library, and you will need a API and a executable.

### Python library

To install the python library, just execute the code below:

### How to use


When you have your API KEY and your file .exe is on the directory, you need to execute the code. When you execute the code, you will put your API KEY and the file name in the terminal as input.
When the process finishe, the files will be saved on [folder](https://github.com/kaykRodr1gu3s/VirusTotal/tree/main/File%20analyzer/csv_behavior).
